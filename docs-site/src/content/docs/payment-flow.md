description: Model subscription, checkout, retry, and exception-heavy payment systems in OpenFlowKit.
---

Payment systems are one of the best use cases for OpenFlowKit because they mix clear business stages with asynchronous branches, retries, and exception handling.

They are also easy to get wrong if the diagram only shows the happy path. OpenFlowKit is a good fit because it lets you start rough, then keep adding operational detail.

## What a useful payment diagram should include

Do not stop at the happy path. Most payment diagrams need:

- entry event
- authorization or charge attempt
- success and failure branches
- retry logic
- manual review path
- customer notification path
- final account state

Depending on the workflow, you may also need:

- fraud or risk review
- webhook handling
- customer notifications
- ledger or billing-state updates

## Suggested node pattern

For a typical subscription or checkout diagram:

- `start` for invoice due or checkout initiated
- `process` for charge, webhook handling, notifications, and retries
- `decision` for gateway outcomes
- `end` for terminal account states

## Strong starting options

You can begin from:

- a blank flowchart canvas
- a payment or SaaS-oriented template
- an AI prompt in Flowpilot
- OpenFlow DSL if the flow should be reviewed as text

## Example prompt

```text
Create a payment recovery flow for a SaaS subscription.
Include invoice due, charge attempt, charge success decision,
smart retries, request updated card, manual fraud review,
customer notification, subscription active, and account downgrade.
```

## Recommended workflow

1. generate or sketch the happy path
2. add all failure and retry branches
3. label edges so business outcomes are explicit
4. use layout to normalize spacing
5. export a visual format for stakeholders and JSON for editable retention

## Why this works well in OpenFlowKit

- branch labeling is easy on edges
- auto layout cleans up decision-heavy graphs
- JSON export gives you a high-fidelity editable backup
- Mermaid and PlantUML export help when finance or platform teams need docs-friendly formats

## Recommended review pattern

After drafting:

1. label every branch edge
2. verify timeout and retry behavior explicitly
3. add notes for webhook or gateway dependencies
4. save a manual snapshot before larger revisions

- **Shareability**: Everyone from the PM to the backend engineer needs to see the same flow.
- **Clarity**: Mapping out happy paths, failures, and webhook retries visually is much easier than reading through Stripe API documentation.
- **Speed**: Use the [Command Center](/command-center/) and AI to generate the boilerplate flow in seconds.

## Example: Stripe Checkout Flow

Here is a common Stripe Checkout implementation mapped out. Notice how we use different node shapes to distinguish between client-side actions, server-side actions, and third-party API calls.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Frontend (React)
    participant Server as Backend (Node.js)
    participant Stripe
    
    User->>Client: Clicks "Pay $50"
    Client->>Server: POST /create-checkout-session
    Server->>Stripe: API Request: Create Session
    Stripe-->>Server: Returns Session ID & URL
    Server-->>Client: Returns Checkout URL
    
    Client->>User: Redirects to Stripe Checkout
    User->>Stripe: Enters Credit Card Info
    
    alt Payment Success
        Stripe-->>User: Redirect to Success URL
        Stripe->>Server: Webhook event: checkout.session.completed
        Server->>Server: Fulfills Order / Updates DB
    else Payment Failure
        Stripe-->>User: Redirect to Cancel URL
        User->>Client: Try Again
    end
```

## Tips for Better Payment Diagrams

1. **Use Swimlanes**: Group actions by responsibility. Put the User in one lane, your API in another, and the Payment Processor (Stripe/PayPal) in a third.
2. **Color Code**: Use green for happy paths (success), red for failure states (declines/insufficient funds), and gray for retries.
3. **Explicit Callouts**: Use the **Annotation Node** to document exact webhook payloads or secret keys needed at specific steps.

## AI Prompt Example

To generate a similar flow using [Ask Flowpilot](/ask-flowpilot/):

> `"Generate a flowchart showing a subscription payment flow using Braintree. Include the client requesting a client token, the server generating it, the user submitting a nonce, and the final server-side transaction creation. Show both success and failure branches."`
