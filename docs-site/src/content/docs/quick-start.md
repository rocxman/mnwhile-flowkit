title: Quick Start
description: Create your first OpenFlowKit diagram from builder templates, imports, AI, code, or the canvas.

This is the fastest reliable way to get productive if you are building software, documenting systems, or preparing technical diagrams for docs and reviews.

## 1. Start from the home screen

The first screen is designed to get you to a useful draft in under a couple of minutes. From there you can:

- create a blank flow
- open an existing browser-stored flow
- duplicate a saved flow
- import a JSON diagram document
- jump directly into templates or Flowpilot

Each document opens in its own editor tab.

## 2. Pick the strongest input you already have

OpenFlowKit works best when you start from the most truthful source available, then refine visually.

### Template-first

Use **Browse Templates** when you need a strong developer-oriented starting structure fast. The starter set includes release flows, incident runbooks, cloud diagrams, sequence flows, C4 context, and network-edge layouts.

### Import or code-first

Use import or the Studio code flows when you already have a technical source artifact:

- Mermaid or OpenFlow DSL for editable diagram-as-code
- SQL or OpenAPI for structured system drafts
- Terraform or Kubernetes text for deterministic infra parsing
- JSON/OpenFlow when you are restoring a saved graph exactly

### Prompt-to-diagram

Switch the right rail to Studio and open the **Flowpilot** tab. Enter a prompt such as:

```text
Create a SaaS onboarding workflow with signup, email verification,
team invite, workspace creation, billing setup, and first success milestone.
```

Use this when the shape is still fuzzy and you want a first draft quickly. For technical work, prompt generation is usually strongest after you already know the systems involved.

If AI is not configured yet, use the **Add key** action to open the shared AI settings modal, choose your provider, and decide whether the key should persist on this device or only for the current session.

### Blank canvas and assets

Use blank canvas when the structure is already in your head and visual iteration is faster than import. Open **Assets** from the Command Center to add sections, notes, wireframes, provider icons, and reusable building blocks.

## 3. Refine the diagram visually

Once something is on the canvas:

- move nodes into rough position
- use the [Properties Panel](/properties-panel/) for exact edits and architecture metadata
- run [Smart Layout](/smart-layout/) when the structure is right but spacing is rough
- use the [Command Center](/command-center/) to search, switch workflows, or insert more assets

## 4. Save recovery points

Before a major AI rewrite or import refresh, review the snapshot/history tooling so you can recover quickly if the new result is worse. See [Playback & History](/playback-history/).

## 5. Share or export the result

Use the export menu when you are ready to move the diagram into docs, design tools, code review threads, or launch assets.

- See [Choose an Export Format](/choose-export-format/)
- See [Exporting](/exporting/)
- See [Collaboration & Sharing](/collaboration-sharing/)
- Use viewer links and embed snippets when you want the diagram to stay live instead of pasting a screenshot
