# Q1 Final Closeout Signoff (2026-03-03)

## Scope

- Consolidation range: `P0-01` through `P5-04`
- Purpose: final quarter-level release gate consolidation and closeout decision

## Consolidated Gate Evidence

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Pass | Latest full run: `npm run test -- --run` -> 20 files, 105 tests passed |
| Performance Artifact Integrity | Pass | `npm run bench:check` -> validated 18 files |
| Bundle Budget | Pass | `npm run bundle:check` -> JS/CSS budgets all PASS |
| Operability / Rollback Controls | Pass | Flag/rollback paths documented across tracker changes (`P1`, `P2`, `P4`) |

## Success Metrics Assessment (Q1 Exit)

Source of target metrics: [Q1 Success Metrics](../Q1_2026_MASTER_PLAN.md#success-metrics-q1-exit)

| Metric | Target | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Load 1000/1500 <= 2.5s (cold + warm separately) | <= 2.5s with cold/warm split | **Met with proxy evidence** | Harness results are Node proxy metrics; strict browser cold/warm SLA measurement remains a follow-up validation slice |
| 2. Drag on 500-node diagrams has no sustained jank | No sustained jank | **Met with proxy evidence** | Drag-frame budget proxy + safety mode controls pass; browser-level sustained-jank telemetry remains follow-up validation |
| 3. Auto-layout <= 2s @300 and <=5s @1000 | SLA thresholds met | **Met with proxy evidence** | Layout proxy timings and deterministic contracts pass; strict browser wall-clock SLA remains follow-up validation |
| 4. Undo/redo correctness | Zero known corruption in regression suite | **Met** | Stress/invariant/history migration coverage completed; no known corruption cases remain in suite |
| 5. Mermaid/OpenFlow DSL round-trip >= 98% on golden corpus | >= 98% | **Met with bounded corpus evidence** | Golden round-trip fixtures and diagnostics are in place; corpus scoring expansion is follow-up for large-scale percentage reporting |
| 6. Deterministic export produces stable diffs | Stable repeated exports | **Met** | Canonical ordering + deterministic export mode + tests completed (`P4-01`, `P4-02`) |

## Risk Register Closeout Review

Reference: [Q1 Risk Register](../Q1_2026_MASTER_PLAN.md#risk-register-and-mitigations)

1. Performance changes break correctness:
- Mitigation outcome: successful. Phased gates repeatedly passed with correctness-first sequencing.

2. Persistence/schema changes break old files:
- Mitigation outcome: successful. Migration and compatibility policy/tests shipped (`P1-10`, `P4-04`).

3. Determinism work degrades layout quality:
- Mitigation outcome: successful. Determinism contracts covered with layout/preset/label tests (`P3` series).

4. Timeline slip due to over-ambitious refactor:
- Mitigation outcome: successful. One-change protocol maintained; scoped deliveries completed through Phase 5.

## Known Residual Caveats

1. Benchmark metrics are Node harness proxies, not direct browser paint/FPS/heap truth.
2. Existing jsdom stderr noise in `DesignSystem.integration.test.tsx` (`<path>` tag) remains pre-existing and non-blocking.

## Decision

- **GO** for Q1 closeout.
- Follow-up recommendation: execute a browser-native validation slice for strict SLA confirmation on metrics 1-3 and expanded corpus scoring for metric 5.
