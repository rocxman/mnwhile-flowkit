## Scope

- Change range: `P4-S1` through `P4-05`
- Focus: deterministic diagram-as-code exports, actionable round-trip diagnostics, and schema/version compatibility guarantees

## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Pass | `npm run test -- --run` -> 20 files, 105 tests passed |
| Performance Artifact Integrity | Pass | `npm run bench:check` -> validated 18 files |
| Bundle Budget | Pass | `npm run bundle:check` -> JS/CSS budgets all PASS |
| Deterministic Export Contract | Pass | Includes canonical ordering + export-mode tests in `canonicalSerialization.test.ts` and `openFlowDSLExporter.test.ts` |
| Round-Trip Diagnostics | Pass | Includes parser/export diagnostics coverage in `openFlowDSLParser.test.ts`, `flowmindDSLParserV2.test.ts`, and `useFlowEditorActions.test.ts` |
| Schema Compatibility Policy | Pass | Includes versioned import/export compatibility coverage in `diagramDocument.test.ts` and published matrix in `docs/schema-compatibility-matrix.md` |

## Noted Warnings

- Existing jsdom stderr noise in `DesignSystem.integration.test.tsx` about `<path>` tag remains; suite still passes and warning is pre-existing.

## Decision

- **GO** for Phase 4 exit.
