# Benchmark Baseline Runbook (Q1 2026)

This runbook defines how to run and capture benchmark baselines for the Q1 plan.

Published reproducibility artifact:

- `docs/benchmark-reproducibility-2026-03-03.md`
- `benchmarks/results/q1-2026-baseline-package-2026-03-03.json`

## Scope

- Fixtures:
  - `benchmarks/fixtures/small-100.json`
  - `benchmarks/fixtures/medium-300.json`
  - `benchmarks/fixtures/large-1000.json`
- Harness scripts:
  - `npm run bench:harness`
  - `npm run bench:summary`

## Important Metric Caveat

Current metrics are **proxy metrics** from Node.js harness workload simulation.
They are useful for relative comparisons and regression checks, but they are not browser paint/FPS/heap truth.

## Modes

- `initial-render`: fixture processing proxy for first-load work.
- `drag-frame-budget`: per-frame drag proxy and `>16ms` frame count.
- `layout`: deterministic layout workload proxy timing.
- `routing-hotspot`: smart-routing CPU pressure proxy timing over full edge-set traversal.
- `heap-growth`: Node.js heap growth proxy across repeated workload iterations.

## Per-Mode Output Files

Each mode writes to:

- `benchmarks/results/<fixture>.<mode>.latest.json`

Examples:

- `benchmarks/results/small-100.initial-render.latest.json`
- `benchmarks/results/medium-300.layout.latest.json`
- `benchmarks/results/large-1000.heap-growth.latest.json`

Summary writes to:

- `benchmarks/results/<fixture>.summary.latest.json`

## Standard Baseline Command Set

Run this sequence per fixture (`small-100`, `medium-300`, `large-1000`):

```bash
npm run bench:harness -- --fixture <fixture> --mode initial-render --iterations 8
npm run bench:harness -- --fixture <fixture> --mode drag-frame-budget --iterations 8
npm run bench:harness -- --fixture <fixture> --mode layout --iterations 8
npm run bench:harness -- --fixture <fixture> --mode routing-hotspot --iterations 8
npm run bench:harness -- --fixture <fixture> --mode heap-growth --iterations 8
npm run bench:summary -- --fixture <fixture>
```

## Baseline Capture Checklist

1. Ensure fixture files exist under `benchmarks/fixtures/`.
2. Run all five modes for each fixture.
3. Generate summary for each fixture.
4. Confirm `status: ok` for all modes in each summary file.
5. Log run details in `docs/q1_execution_tracker.md`.

## Interpreting Results Safely

- Compare **median** and **p95** first; do not optimize for single-sample outliers.
- Treat sudden large p95 shifts as investigation triggers, not immediate regression conclusions.
- Keep caveat language when reporting numbers externally:
  - "Proxy benchmark from Node harness, not browser runtime metrics."
