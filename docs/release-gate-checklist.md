# Release Gate Checklist (Q1 2026)

Use this checklist before merging/releasing any risky change in Q1.

## Required Inputs

- Active change ID from `docs/q1_execution_tracker.md`
- Baseline reference fixture(s): `small-100`, `medium-300`, `large-1000`
- Current benchmark artifacts under `benchmarks/results/`

## Gate Commands

Run in this order:

```bash
npm run test -- --run
npm run bench:check
npm run bundle:check
```

Optional when build-risk is high:

```bash
npm run build:ci
```

## Go/No-Go Criteria

Mark each criterion as `Pass` or `Fail`.

| Gate | Pass Condition | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Test suite for affected scope passes with no new failures |  |  |
| Performance Artifact Integrity | `bench:check` passes and all required benchmark files are valid |  |  |
| Performance Delta Review | Median/p95 deltas reviewed vs prior baseline; no unexplained severe regression |  |  |
| Bundle Budget | `bundle:check` passes within configured limits |  |  |
| Determinism/Serialization (if touched) | Export/layout determinism checks pass for touched flows |  |  |
| Rollback Readiness | Rollback command/path documented and tested mentally |  |  |

Release decision:

- `GO` only if all required gates pass.
- `NO-GO` if any required gate fails.

## Signoff

| Field | Value |
