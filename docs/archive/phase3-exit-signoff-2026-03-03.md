## Scope

- Change range: `P3-01` through `P3-07`
- Focus: deterministic layout contracts, preset consistency, and label-placement stability

## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Pass | `npm run test -- --run` -> 15 files, 85 tests passed |
| Performance Artifact Integrity | Pass | `npm run bench:check` -> validated 18 files |
| Bundle Budget | Pass | `npm run bundle:check` -> JS/CSS budgets all PASS |
| Deterministic Layout Contract Coverage | Pass | Includes `elkLayout.test.ts` covering ordering, component tie-breaks, seeded/fallback behavior, and preset consistency |
| Label Placement Preservation | Pass | Includes `smartEdgeRouting.test.ts` case preserving `labelPosition` and offsets during reroute updates |

## Noted Warnings

- Existing jsdom stderr noise in `DesignSystem.integration.test.tsx` about `<path>` tag remains; suite still passes and warning is pre-existing.

## Decision

- **GO** for Phase 3 exit.
