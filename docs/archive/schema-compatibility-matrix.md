# Schema Compatibility Matrix

This document defines compatibility guarantees for FlowMind JSON documents and OpenFlow DSL text inputs.

## JSON Document Schema

Current writer version: `1.0`

| Input Version | Import Support | Behavior | Guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1.x` | Supported | Loads without compatibility warnings | Backward-compatible within major version 1 |
| Missing `version` | Supported (legacy mode) | Loads with warning: legacy unversioned payload | Existing older exports remain loadable |
| `2.x` or higher | Not supported | Import blocked with explicit error | Prevents silent corruption on unknown major schema |

Writer policy:
- Exports always include `version`, `name`, `createdAt`, `nodes`, `edges`.
- Current writer version remains `1.0` until a breaking schema change is introduced.

## OpenFlow DSL

Supported syntax family: **FlowMind DSL V2**.

Compatibility notes:
- Parser accepts V2 syntax (`[type] id: Label`, edge arrows, `group "Name" { ... }`).
- Parser preserves backward-friendly shorthand where possible (e.g., implicit node creation from `A -> B`).
- Invalid/unrecognized lines are surfaced with actionable diagnostics (`line`, `snippet`, `hint`).

Migration policy:
- Additive syntax changes in V2 are treated as backward-compatible.
- Breaking syntax changes require a new major DSL version and explicit migration notes.

## Migration Guarantees

1. Existing unversioned JSON exports continue to import through compatibility mode.
2. Existing `1.x` JSON files continue to import without data-loss migration.
3. Unsupported future major versions fail fast with an explicit error message.
4. Parser/export diagnostics are improved without mutating valid user payload semantics.
