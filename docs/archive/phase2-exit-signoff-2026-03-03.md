## Scope

- Change range: `P2-01` through `P2-07`
- Focus: routing/runtime performance safeguards with controlled visual-cost reductions

## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Pass | `npm run test -- --run` -> 14 files, 74 tests passed |
| Performance Artifact Integrity | Pass | `npm run bench:check` -> validated 18 files |
| Bundle Budget | Pass | `npm run bundle:check` -> JS/CSS budgets all PASS |
| Routing Safety Coverage | Pass | Includes `smartEdgeRouting`, `routingDuringDrag`, `dragStopReconcilePolicy`, and `largeGraphSafetyMode` test suites in full run |
| Large Graph Safety Override | Pass | `largeGraphSafetyMode` supports `auto/on/off` with policy tests passing |

## Noted Warnings

- Existing jsdom stderr noise in `DesignSystem.integration.test.tsx` about `<path>` tag remains; suite still passes and warning is pre-existing.
