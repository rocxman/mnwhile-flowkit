# History Model Gap Analysis (Phase 1)

Date: 2026-03-03

## Objective

Identify gaps between current undo/redo implementation and Phase 1 goals:

- No undo/redo corruption in stress tests
- Deterministic limits by count and memory budget
- Stable behavior across tab switching and persistence

## Current Implementation Summary

- Runtime undo/redo state lives in `useFlowHistory` local hook state (`past`, `future`).
- `FlowTab.history` exists in types but is not the active source of truth for runtime history transitions.
- Global store persists `tabs`, `activeTabId`, and other settings via Zustand `persist`.
- Tab switching uses `setActiveTabId`, which saves current `nodes/edges` to current tab and loads target tab `nodes/edges`.

## Observed Gaps

1. Split-brain history ownership:
- Runtime history is hook-local.
- Tab model contains history fields but runtime logic does not consistently use them.
- Risk: history state can diverge from tab state, especially across route changes/remounts.

2. No explicit memory budget control:
- Count cap exists (`MAX_HISTORY = 20`), but no size-based trimming.
- Large snapshots can cause uneven memory pressure despite count cap.

3. Snapshot model is full-state only:
- Every history entry stores whole `nodes/edges`.
- Predictable but expensive; no patch/command compression.

4. Same-tab switch edge case in `setActiveTabId`:
- Calling `setActiveTabId` with the current id can re-save current canvas into tab before reload path.
- This can be a no-op in many flows, but is an avoidable risk and should be guarded.

5. Hydration/recovery path is implicit:
- Persisted `tabs`/`activeTabId` rehydrate, but canvas restoration behavior depends on call order.
- Recovery should be explicit and deterministic.

## Test Coverage Status (After P1-01..P1-04)

Covered:
- Undo/redo invariants
- Long mixed undo/redo stress
- Boundary no-op safety
- History cap behavior under higher snapshot load
- Tab isolation across repeated switches
- Persisted payload recovery behavior

Still missing:
- Runtime memory-budget trim assertions (bytes/estimated size thresholds)
- Per-tab history continuity assertions after tab switch + remount semantics
- Migration compatibility tests if history model changes

## Recommended Target Model (Phase 1 Scope)

1. Single source of truth:
- Move active history ownership into store/tab state.
- `useFlowHistory` becomes a thin adapter over store actions/selectors.

2. Explicit history policy:
- Keep count cap (`maxEntries`) and add memory budget (`maxEstimatedBytes`).
- Trim oldest snapshots until both constraints pass.

3. Deterministic tab-aware history:
- Keep `past/future` alongside each tab and restore when switching tabs.
- Ensure route remount does not reset history unexpectedly.

4. Safe tab switch behavior:
- Add early return in `setActiveTabId` when `id === activeTabId`.

5. Controlled rollout:
- Introduce feature flag (e.g., `historyModelV2`) for migration.
- Run existing history/store test suites for both old/new paths until stable.

## Proposed Implementation Steps

1. `P1-06`: Add same-tab guard in `setActiveTabId` and tests.
2. `P1-07`: Introduce store-level history state/actions (behind flag).
3. `P1-08`: Add estimated-size accounting + memory budget trimming.
4. `P1-09`: Wire tab switch to persist/restore per-tab history deterministically.
5. `P1-10`: Add migration adapter for existing persisted tabs lacking normalized history metadata.

## Success Criteria for This Workstream

- No regressions in current history/store tests.
- New tests verify memory budget trimming behavior.
- Undo/redo continuity preserved across tab switches and remount-style flows.
- Rollback path remains available via feature flag.
- Pilot rollout follows [History V2 Pilot Checklist](docs/history-v2-pilot-checklist.md).
