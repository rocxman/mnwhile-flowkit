## 🔥 Key Features

### �️ White-Label Brand Engine
Make FlowMind your own. Our state-of-the-art theming system allows you to completely re-skin the editor:
-   **Brand Kits**: create unlimited identity presets (e.g., "Client A", "Dark Mode", "Wireframe").
-   **Dynamic Typography**: Automatically loads and applies **Google Fonts** to match your website.
-   **Smart Coloring**: Provide your brand's Primary Color, and we auto-generate a harmonious palette (Surface, Background, Accents).
-   **UI Physics**: Toggle **Glassmorphism**, adjust **Corner Radiuses**, and fine-tune border weights.

### 💠 Design Systems & Styling
Fine-grained control over how your diagrams look.
- **Component-Level Styling**: Define exact styles for **Nodes** (Shape, Color, Border) and **Edges** (Stroke, Pattern, Routing).
- **Design System Panel**: Manage your design tokens directly relative to the canvas.
- **Smart Inheritance**: New nodes automatically inherit the active design system's properties.

### 🖌️ Native Figma Export
Stop screenshotting your diagrams. FlowMind generates clean, structured SVGs that behave like native Figma layers.
- **Editable Text**: Labels and sublabels export as `<text>` blocks, not paths. Fix typos in Figma without redrawing.
- **Vector Fidelity**: Perfect rounded corners, gradients, and stroke precision.
- **One-Click Copy**: Just hit "Copy for Figma" and paste (Cmd+V).

### 🛠 Advanced Diagram as Code
First-class support for **Mermaid.js** and our own **FlowMind DSL**.
- **Expanded Support**: Now supporting **Flowcharts**, **State Diagrams**, and **Subgraphs** (Groups).
- **Live Sync**: Tweaking the visual graph updates the underlying code structure.

### 💎 Premium UX & Smart Editor
- **Intelligent Properties Panel**: Context-aware side panel for editing Node/Edge properties with brand-aware controls.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` Command Bar for instant access to every action.
- **Home Dashboard**: A beautiful, minimalist dashboard to manage your recent flows and brand settings.
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for image assets and nodes.
- **Universal Handles**: Omni-directional connection points that just work.

### 🔑 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
Use your own **Gemini API Key** to power the AI features.
-   **Privacy First**: Your key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers.
-   **Higher Limits**: Use your personal quota for heavy usage.
-   **Cost Control**: Manage your own billing directly with Google.

### 📤 Universal Export
Export your diagrams to the format you need.
-   **High-Res PNG**: Crystal clear images for presentations.
-   **Native SVG**: Scalable vectors for print or web.
-   **JSON & Mermaid**: Export the raw code to share or version control.

### 📐 Advanced Auto-Layout
Powered by the **ELK Layout Engine** for professional-grade graph organization.
- **4 Algorithms**: Layered (standard flow), Tree (org charts), Force (organic networks), and Radial.
- **Animated Transitions**: Watch your graph smoothly reorganize itself.
