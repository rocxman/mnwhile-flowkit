## 🌟 Why OpenFlowKit?

-   **MIT Licensed**: 100% free to use, fork, and integrate into commercial products.
-   **Pure White-Label**: The UI dynamically absorbs **YOUR** brand tokens. It looks like your product, not a third-party plugin.
-   **Diagram-as-Code Native**: Full compatibility with **Mermaid.js** and our type-safe DSL.
-   **High-Fidelity UX**: Glassmorphism, smooth animations, and CAD-inspired aesthetics out of the box.
-   **Privacy First**: Local-first architecture with optional BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for AI features.

## 🔥 Key Features

### ⚪ White-Label Brand Engine
Don't just embed a tool—embed **your brand**. Our engine generates harmonious palettes from a single primary color:

-   **Brand Kits**: Toggle between "Wireframe", "Executive", or "Dark Mode" identities.
-   **Dynamic Typography**: Natively supports **Google Fonts** integration.
-   **UI Physics**: Fine-tune glassmorphism, corner radiuses, and border weights via CSS variables.

### 🖌️ Native Figma Export
Generate clean, structured SVGs that behave like native Figma layers.
- **Vector Fidelity**: Perfect rounded corners and gradients.
- **Editable Text**: Labels export as text blocks, not paths.
- **One-Click Copy**: Paste directly into Figma with standard Cmd+V.

### 🛠 Advanced Diagram-as-Code
First-class support for **Mermaid.js** and the **OpenFlow DSL**.
- **Mermaid Support**: Flowcharts, State Diagrams, and Subgraphs.
- **Live Two-Way Sync**: Tweak the visual graph and watch the code update in real-time.
- **Auto-Layout**: Industrial-grade layout algorithms powered by ELK.js.

### ⚛️ Built on React Flow
Leveraging the industry standard for node-based UIs, OpenFlowKit is highly performant and infinitely extensible.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Project Structure

Built for performance and extensibility using the best modern web tech:

- **Core**: [React Flow 11](https://reactflow.dev/) + [Vite 6](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **State**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for high-performance persistence.
- **Language**: [TypeScript 5.8](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for robust type safety.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) + CSS Design Tokens.
